# To simulate ideal bosons in a 3D harmonic trap, we start with the 
# identity permutation and with random positions sampled from the diagonal
# harmonic density matrix in x, y and z. For each particle move, we sample a 
# random particle, identify its permutation cycle, and sample a new Lévy 
# quantum path for the entire cycle. For each permutation move, 
# we sample 2 random particles like this and this,
# and we attempt an exchange of their permutation partners.
 
'''
This function is used at multiples of the inverse temperature beta,
corresponding to the length of some permutation cycle. 
We use it to resample the positions of the entire cycle.

  Parameters:
    k       Length of some permutation cycle
    beta    Inverse temperature
    
  Returns:
    A vector containg 'k' points in 3 dimensional space
